        There are several known

                    Long duration buffs like those from flasks, elixirs, weapon oils and stones can't be reliably
                    tracked on trash fights.

                    Different consumables can have the same effect and therefore it's not possible to determined from
                    the logs which consumable was actually used. This issue is most notably visible on the food buffs.

                    Demonic Runes are BoP and cannot be sold on auction house. For estimating their value we're using
                    the price of Dark Runes instead.

                    Prices are loaded from <a href='https://nexushub.co/'>NexusHub</a> when you load the report on this
                    page and can differ from the prices at the time the report was created.

            We're still missing a bunch of consumables in our database. If there's a consumable you're using that shows
            up on <a href='https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/'>Warcraft Logs</a> but is missing here, don't hesitate to
